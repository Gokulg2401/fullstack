/**
 * INVERSION OF CONTROL (IoC) CONTAINER DEMO
 * 
 * This class demonstrates how Spring's IoC Container manages object creation,
 * dependency resolution, and lifecycle management.
 * 
 * IoC Container Benefits:
 * 1. Automatic object creation and management
 * 2. Dependency resolution at runtime
 * 3. Lifecycle management (creation, initialization, destruction)
 * 4. Configuration management
 * 5. Singleton pattern enforcement (by default)
 * 
 * Key IoC Concepts:
 * - Container manages object creation (not the developer)
 * - Dependencies are "injected" rather than "created"
 * - Objects are configured externally (via annotations or XML)
